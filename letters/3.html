          <h1>A SPACE FOR HUMAN BEINGS</h1>
          <p>Much too often, we allow how we want others to perceive us to take priority in how we design our spaces and let the burden of our belongings to dictate the ways we live.   We shouldn&rsquo;t let these pressures seep in, lest we want to be constantly reminded how much others&rsquo; opinions matter to us. (They shouldn&rsquo;t.)</p>

          <p>Instead run the opposite way: <strong>embrace imperfection and practicality over flair and flourish.</strong></p>

          <p><em>Keep in mind the people who matter:</em> You, your friends, your family, not a photographer or voice of the judgemental stranger in your head. The people who matter don't expect a perfect, magazine-worthy home; they want your home to feel like your imperfect, wonderful self.</p>

          <p><em>Put there where they make sense.</em> We should be proud to put our most beloved, most frequently used things front and center. Don&rsquo;t feel the need to hide everything behind cabinet doors. You should only feel the need to get and put away someone five times a day when you&rsquo;re staying as a guest in a stranger&rsquo;s home, not your own.</p>

          <p><em>Don't decorate for other people.</em> For all those decorative adornments, unless they have a meaning for you or make your feel happy (then the brightly colored pillows or lively green plant serve a wonderful purpose), don&rsquo;t put something there just to fill the space or because it&rsquo;s trendy to do so.</p>

          <div class = "content">
            <h1>A SPACE THAT IS BEAUTIFUL</h1>
            <p>&ldquo;<em>Believe</em> to be beautiful.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s really the heart of William Morris&rsquo; famous quote. To design spaces with intention, an awareness of what that means to us &ndash; what believe is beautiful &ndash; is important.</p>
            <p>Don&rsquo;t think about it in the way that Architectural Digest might &ndash; an expectation that might lead you to question whether your spaces are spotless, on-trend and stylish. Instead, ask yourself the following: <em>Do the things in your home make you feel happy? Do they remind you of things that are important and meaningful to you? Do they represent or showcase what you really love and who you really are?</em></p>
            <p>The most wonderful, beautiful homes are rich with meaning, where every object we can point to has a story and reason for sitting where it sits. They&rsquo;re spaces that are thoughtful and reflect our own character. They&rsquo;re unquestionably unique. They&rsquo;re designed with intention.</p>
            <p>Think about it this way: when you welcome someone in your space like this, it should make you feel just a bit vulnerable. It&rsquo;s the same wonderful feeling you feel when you first let down your guard with a new friend, and letting that quirky, imperfect side of you out. That&rsquo;s the mark of a beautiful space.</p>

          <p>&ndash; <strong>Don Norman</strong> in <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></p>
        </blockquote>

        <div class = "content">
          <h1>A SPACE FOR OUR FUTURE SELVES</h1>
          <p>Human-centered designers like Don Norman understand that the way that we design our circumstances &ndash; that is, our environment, our spaces, and the objects that we use &ndash; affect how we behave.</p>
          <p>So when we reflect on our own spaces, remember that we&rsquo;re designing for a future version of ourselves. That person will wake up every morning, and see and experience what you&rsquo;ve decided to place in your home. In choosing the objects that serve as cues for certain behaviors, feelings and habits, we have the power to change how we behave.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it important that we ask ourselves the questions and design our spaces with this intention in mind. <em>How do you want to behave in that space? How would you like to feel? What would you like to be reminded of?</em></p>
          <p>When we decide to place that book on our nightstands and exile our phones from the bedroom, we nudge ourselves to spend those 30 minutes before bedtime reading instead of on the phone. When we create that dedicated space to breathe, we remind ourselves to sit and meditate in the morning.</p>
          <p>The space we create for future selves dictates that kind of people we want to become. <em>What kind of person do you want to become? What kind of space should you therefore create?</em></p>
