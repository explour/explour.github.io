          <p>Hello and welcome.</p>

          <p>At <em>arrive home</em>, we care deeply about helping you design spaces with intention. We believe that by thoughtfully and intentionally designing our spaces, we can help ourselves become the people we aspire to be: to be present, to be grateful, to be the best versions of ourselves.</p>

          <p>We would be honored to send you a short but thoughtful letter every Sunday morning to help you think about how to design our spaces in this way and to show you how others have done so.</p>

            <h1>A SPACE FOR HUMAN BEINGS</h1>
            <p>Much too often, we allow how we want others to perceive us to take priority in how we design our spaces. We allow the burden of our belongings to dictate the ways we live.</p>

            <p>We shouldn&apos;t let these pressures seep into how we design our spaces, lest we want to be constantly reminded how much others&apos; opinions matter to us. (They shouldn&apos;t). Instead, run the opposite way:</p>

            <p><em>Embrace imperfection and practicality over flair and flourish.</em> It&apos;s simple: design your homes based on what makes sense for how you live. Design your homes for the people who matter &dash; you, your friends and your family. Those people dont expect your perfection; they want your home to be you.</p>

            <p><em>Put things where they make sense.</em> We should be proud to put our most beloved, most frequently used objects front and center. Don&apos;t feel the need to hide everything behind cabinet doors. You should only feel the need to get and put away something five times away when you&apos;re staying as a guest in a stranger&apos;s home, not in your own.</p>

            <p><em>Get rid of the useless, purely decorative adornments.</em> Unless they have a meaning for you or make you feel happy (then, the brightly coloured pillows or lively green plant serve a wonderful purpose), don&apos;t put something there just to fill the space or because it&apos;s trendy to do so. Keep things that you use or have meaning to you; get rid of everything else.</p>

            <p>When I think of this quote, I&apos;d like to think that he doesn&apos;t mean beautiful in the broad sense that Architectual Digest does. What he means is beautiful for us.</p>
            <p>Do the things in your home make you feel happy? Do they remind you of things that are important and meaningful to you? Do they represent or showcase who you are? Do you therefore believe they are beautiful?</p>
            <p>The most wonderful homes are rich with meaning, where every object we can point to has a story or reason for sitting where it sits. They&apos;re spaces that are thoughtful and reflect our own character. They&apos;re unquestionably unique.</p>
            <p>Think about it this way: when you welcome someone in your space like this, it should make you feel just a bit vulnerable. It&apos;s that wonderful feeling that comes with letting your guard down a bit with a new friend and letting that quirky, imperfect side of you out. That&apos;s the mark of a space that is meaningful to you.</p>

            <h1>DESIGNING FOR OUR FUTURE SELVES</h1>
            <p>We design our own circumstances; we design our spaces for a future version of ourselves. That person will wake up every morning, and then see and experience what you&apos;ve decided to place in that space. It matters that you answer these questions: What do you want to do in that space? How would you like to feel? What would you like to be reminded of?</p>
            <p>All of the objects we place around our homes serve as cues for how we behave. They&apos;re anchors for the habits that we engage in every day.</p>
            <p>We have the power to change how we behave with these little decisions about our spaces. When we decide to book that book on our nightstands and exile our phones from the bedroom, we nudge ourselves to spend those 30 minutes before bedtime reading instead of on the phone. When we create that dedicated space to breathe, we remind ourselves to sit and meditate in the morning.</p>
            <p>The spaces we create for ourselves dictate the kind of people we want to become. <em>So, what kind of person do you want to be?</em></p>
