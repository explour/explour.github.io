          <p>Hello and welcome.</p>

          <p>At <em>arrive home</em>, we care deeply about helping you design spaces with intention. We believe that by thoughtfully and intentionally designing our spaces, we can help ourselves become the people we aspire to be: to be present, to be grateful, to be the best versions of ourselves.</p>

          <p>We would be honored to send you a short but thoughtful letter every Sunday morning to help you think about how to design our spaces in this way and to show you how others have done so.</p>

          <p>Here&apos;s <a id = "sneak-peak-button">a sneak peak of our first letter.</a></p>
          <p>If you would like, please let us know where you would like us to send it:</p>

            <h1>A SPACE FOR HUMAN BEINGS</h1>
            <p>Much too often, we allow how we want others to perceive us to take priority in how we design our spaces. We allow the burden of our belongings to dictate the ways we live.</p>

            <p>We shouldn&apos;t let these pressures seep into how we design our spaces, lest we want to be constantly reminded how much others&apos; opinions matter to us. (They shouldn&apos;t). Instead, run the opposite way:</p>

            <p><em>Embrace imperfection and practicality over flair and flourish.</em> It&apos;s simple: design your homes based on what makes sense for how you live. Design your homes for the people who matter &dash; you, your friends and your family. Those people dont expect your perfection; they want your home to be you.</p>

            <p><em>Put things where they make sense.</em> We should be proud to put our most beloved, most frequently used objects front and center. Don&apos;t feel the need to hide everything behind cabinet doors. You should only feel the need to get and put away something five times away when you&apos;re staying as a guest in a stranger&apos;s home, not in your own.</p>

            <p><em>Get rid of the useless, purely decorative adornments.</em> Unless they have a meaning for you or make you feel happy (then, the brightly coloured pillows or lively green plant serve a wonderful purpose), don&apos;t put something there just to fill the space or because it&apos;s trendy to do so. Keep things that you use or have meaning to you; get rid of everything else.</p>
